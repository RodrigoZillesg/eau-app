# Deployment Status Report - EAU App
**Date**: 2025-09-02
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Deployment Failed - Troubleshooting Required

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Repository Setup
- ‚úÖ Created GitHub repository: https://github.com/RodrigoZillesg/eau-app
- ‚úÖ Pushed all code successfully
- ‚úÖ Repository is public and accessible

### 2. Backend Development
- ‚úÖ Created Node.js/TypeScript backend with Express
- ‚úÖ Implemented authentication system
- ‚úÖ Created all necessary API endpoints
- ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation working locally

### 3. Frontend Development
- ‚úÖ React 18 + Vite application
- ‚úÖ Full membership management system
- ‚úÖ Working locally on port 5180

### 4. Docker Configuration
- ‚úÖ Created Dockerfile for backend (with TypeScript build)
- ‚úÖ Created Dockerfile for frontend (with nginx)
- ‚úÖ Created docker-compose.yml files for both services
- ‚úÖ Fixed healthcheck commands

### 5. EasyPanel Configuration
- ‚úÖ Created services: eau-backend and eau-frontend
- ‚úÖ Configured Git source with:
  - Repository: https://github.com/RodrigoZillesg/eau-app.git
  - Branch: main
  - Build paths: eau-backend/ and eau-members/
- ‚úÖ Set all environment variables
- ‚úÖ Updated docker-compose content directly in EasyPanel

## ‚ùå Current Issues

### Primary Problem: Deployments Failing Immediately (0 seconds)
**Symptoms**:
- All deployment attempts show "0 seconds" duration
- No logs are generated
- Services never start

**Possible Causes**:
1. **Git Access Issue**: EasyPanel might not be able to clone the repository
   - Repository is public, so authentication shouldn't be required
   - URL format might be incorrect for EasyPanel

2. **Docker Compose Format**: EasyPanel might expect a different format
   - Currently using simplified version 3 format
   - Might need specific EasyPanel directives

3. **Build Context Issue**: The build path configuration might be incorrect
   - Currently set to subdirectories (eau-backend/, eau-members/)
   - EasyPanel might not handle subdirectory builds correctly

4. **Port Conflicts**: Ports might already be in use
   - Backend: 3001
   - Frontend: 80

## üîß Attempted Solutions

1. **Fixed TypeScript Build**: Updated Dockerfile to compile TypeScript
2. **Simplified docker-compose**: Removed complex healthchecks
3. **Direct Content Update**: Manually updated docker-compose content in EasyPanel
4. **Multiple Deploy Attempts**: Tried deploying multiple times after each fix

## üìã Next Steps to Try

### Option 1: Check EasyPanel Logs
- Access EasyPanel server logs (may require SSH access)
- Look for Git clone errors or Docker build failures

### Option 2: Use Pre-built Images
Instead of building from source:
1. Build Docker images locally
2. Push to Docker Hub
3. Configure EasyPanel to use pre-built images

### Option 3: Single Repository Approach
- Move docker-compose.yml to root directory
- Update build contexts to use relative paths
- Reconfigure EasyPanel to use root-level docker-compose

### Option 4: Manual Docker Deployment
If EasyPanel continues to fail:
1. SSH into server
2. Clone repository manually
3. Run docker-compose up directly

## üìä Service URLs (When Working)

- **Backend API**: http://91.108.104.122:3001
- **Frontend App**: http://91.108.104.122:80
- **EasyPanel**: http://91.108.104.122:3000

## üîë Key Configuration Files

### Backend docker-compose.yml
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3001:3001"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - PORT=3001
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### Frontend docker-compose.yml
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## üí° Recommendations

1. **Contact EasyPanel Support**: The 0-second failures suggest a configuration issue
2. **Check Server Resources**: Ensure server has enough disk space and memory
3. **Review EasyPanel Documentation**: Look for specific requirements for Docker Compose format
4. **Consider Alternative Deployment**: If EasyPanel continues to fail, consider:
   - Direct Docker deployment via SSH
   - Alternative PaaS like Railway, Render, or Fly.io
   - Traditional VPS setup with nginx reverse proxy

## üìù Notes for User

The deployment infrastructure is correctly set up, but EasyPanel is not processing the deployments. The most likely issue is a configuration mismatch between what EasyPanel expects and what we've provided. 

**Immediate Actions Needed**:
1. Check if there are any error messages in EasyPanel's system logs
2. Verify that the server has Docker and Docker Compose installed
3. Consider trying the deployment with a simpler test application first
